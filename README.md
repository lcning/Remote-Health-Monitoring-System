# Remote-Health-Monitoring-System

PolyU Honors Project

This project is the honors project for BEng degree in Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and was supervised by Dr. Lawrence Cheung. It was jointly finished with Fei, who focused on the ECG data detection and transmission. My part mainly focused on building up a machine learning based 5-class arrhythmia classifier. All the training and testing recordings are from MIT-BIH database. 

• Used wavelet transform to extract locations of P, Q, R, S and T wave
• Selected 12 features based on 4 research papers as the input of the DNN classifier
• Constructed and optimized a 5-class DNN classifier, focusing on imbalanced dataset training
• Achieved an overall accuracy of 93.6% and improved arrhythmia class sensitivity up to 80+%
• Nominated: Outstanding Presentation Award (Top 2 in EIE department)
